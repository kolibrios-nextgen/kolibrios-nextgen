; OHCI-specific part of a pipe descriptor.
; * This structure corresponds to the Endpoint Descriptor aka ED from the OHCI
;   specification.
; * The hardware requires 16-bytes alignment of the hardware part.
;   Since the allocator (usb_allocate_common) allocates memory sequentially
;   from page start (aligned on 0x1000 bytes), block size for the allocator
;   must be divisible by 16; usb1_allocate_endpoint ensures this.
struct ohci_pipe
; All addresses are physical.
Flags           dd      ?
; 1. Lower 7 bits (bits 0-6) are FunctionAddress. This is the USB address of
;    the function containing the endpoint that this ED controls.
; 2. Next 4 bits (bits 7-10) are EndpointNumber. This is the USB address of
;    the endpoint within the function.
; 3. Next 2 bits (bits 11-12) are Direction. This 2-bit field indicates the
;    direction of data flow: 1 = OUT, 2 = IN. If neither IN nor OUT is
;    specified, then the direction is determined from the PID field of the TD.
;    For CONTROL endpoints, the transfer direction is different
;    for different transfers, so the value of this field is 0
;    (3 would have the same effect) and the actual direction
;    of one transfer is encoded in the Transfer Descriptor.
; 4. Next bit (bit 13) is Speed bit. It indicates the speed of the endpoint:
;    full-speed (S = 0) or low-speed (S = 1).
; 5. Next bit (bit 14) is sKip bit. When this bit is set, the hardware
;    continues on to the next ED on the list without attempting access
;    to the TD queue or issuing any USB token for the endpoint.
;    Always cleared.
; 6. Next bit (bit 15) is Format bit. It must be 0 for Control, Bulk and
;    Interrupt endpoints and 1 for Isochronous endpoints.
; 7. Next 11 bits (bits 16-26) are MaximumPacketSize. This field indicates
;    the maximum number of bytes that can be sent to or received from the
;    endpoint in a single data packet.
TailP           dd      ?
; Physical address of the tail descriptor in the TD queue.
; The descriptor itself is not in the queue. See also HeadP.
HeadP           dd      ?
; 1. First bit (bit 0) is Halted bit. This bit is set by the hardware to
;    indicate that processing of the TD queue on the endpoint is halted.
; 2. Second bit (bit 1) is toggleCarry bit. Whenever a TD is retired, this
;    bit is written to contain the last data toggle value from the retired TD.
; 3. Next two bits (bits 2-3) are reserved and always zero.
; 4. With masked 4 lower bits, this is HeadP itself: physical address of the
;    head descriptor in the TD queue, that is, next TD to be processed for this
;    endpoint. Note that a TD must be 16-bytes aligned.
;    Empty queue is characterized by the condition HeadP == TailP.
NextED          dd      ?
; If nonzero, then this entry is a physical address of the next ED to be
; processed. See also the description before NextVirt field of the usb_pipe
; structure. Additionally to that description, the following is specific for
; the OHCI controller:
; * n=5, N=32, there are 32 "leaf" periodic lists.
; * The 1ms periodic list also serves Isochronous endpoints, which should be
;   in the end of the list.
; * There is no "next" list for Bulk and Control lists, they are processed
;   separately from others.
; * There is no "next" list for Periodic list for 1ms interval.

; OHCI-specific part of controller data.
; * The structure describes the memory area used for controller data,
;   additionally to the registers of the controller.

; * The hardware part consists of first 256 bytes and corresponds to
;   the HCCA from OHCI specification.
; * The hardware requires 256-bytes alignment of the hardware part, so
;   the entire descriptor must be 256-bytes aligned.
;   This structure is allocated with kernel_alloc (see usb_init_controller),
;   this gives page-aligned data.
; * The controller is described by both ohci_controller and usb_controller
;   structures, for each controller there is one ohci_controller and one
;   usb_controller structure. These structures are located sequentially
;   in the memory: beginning from some page start, there is ohci_controller
;   structure - this enforces hardware alignment requirements - and then
;   usb_controller structure.
; * The code keeps pointer to usb_controller structure. The ohci_controller
;   structure is addressed as [ptr + ohci_controller.field - sizeof.ohci_controller].

; OHCI general transfer descriptor.
; * The structure describes transfers to be performed on Control, Bulk or
;   Interrupt endpoints.
; * The structure includes two parts, the hardware part and the software part.
; * The hardware part consists of first 16 bytes and corresponds to
;   the General Transfer Descriptor aka general TD from OHCI specification.
; * The hardware requires 16-bytes alignment of the hardware part, so
;   the entire descriptor must be 16-bytes aligned. Since the allocator
;   (usb_allocate_common) allocates memory sequentially from page start
;   (aligned on 0x1000 bytes), block size for the allocator must be

Flags           dd      ?
; 1. Lower 18 bits (bits 0-17) are ignored and not modified by the hardware.
; 2. Next bit (bit 18) is bufferRounding bit. If this bit is 0, then the last
;    data packet must exactly fill the defined data buffer. If this bit is 1,
;    then the last data packet may be smaller than the defined buffer without
;    causing an error condition on the TD.
; 3. Next 2 bits (bits 19-20) are Direction field. This field indicates the
;    direction of data flow. If the Direction field in the ED is OUT or IN,
;    this field is ignored and the direction from the ED is used instead.
;    Otherwise, 0 = SETUP, 1 = OUT, 2 = IN, 3 is reserved.
; 4. Next 3 bits (bits 21-23) are DelayInterrupt field. This field contains
;    the interrupt delay count for this TD. When a TD is complete, the hardware
;    may wait up to DelayInterrupt frames before generating an interrupt.
;    If DelayInterrupt is 7 (maximum possible), then there is no interrupt
;    associated with completion of this TD.
; 5. Next 2 bits (bits 24-25) are DataToggle field. This field is used to
;    generate/compare the data PID value (DATA0 or DATA1). It is updated after
;    each successful transmission/reception of a data packet. The bit 25
;    is 0 when the data toggle value is acquired from the toggleCarry field in
;    the ED and 1 when the data toggle value is taken from the bit 24.
; 6. Next 2 bits (bits 26-27) are ErrorCount field. For each transmission
;    error, this value is incremented. If ErrorCount is 2 and another error
;    occurs, the TD is retired with error. When a transaction completes without
;    error, ErrorCount is reset to 0.
; 7. Upper 4 bits (bits 28-31) are ConditionCode field. This field contains
;    the status of the last attempted transaction, one of USB_STATUS_* values.
CurBufPtr       dd      ?

; When the descriptor is queued for processing, but not yet processed:
;   Physical address of the next TD for the endpoint.
; When the descriptor is processed by hardware, but not yet by software:
;   Physical address of the previous processed TD.
; When the descriptor is processed by the IRQ handler, but not yet completed:

; OHCI isochronous transfer descriptor.
; * The structure describes transfers to be performed on Isochronous endpoints.

; * The hardware part consists of first 32 bytes and corresponds to
;   the Isochronous Transfer Descriptor aka isochronous TD from OHCI
;   specification.
; * The hardware requires 32-bytes alignment of the hardware part, so
;   the entire descriptor must be 32-bytes aligned.
